                    <b>Session Storage:</b> <br>
                    <p>The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. SessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</p>

                    <b>Local Storage:</b><br>
                    <p>The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. LocalStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends that is, when the page is closed.</p>

                    <p>We often hear that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it executes all of the instructions line by line in a synchronous manner. Thus since everything works on the main thread, there seems to be no possibility of executing parallel processes in JavaScript. But now let's assume that we have a function which is taking some time to execute, for example in the below function which is having a loop over 10k times, the console.log() would be executed once the loop is over and in the meantime, our UI interaction with the browser would be interrupted.
                    <br><br>
                    Memory Heap — this is where the memory allocation happens, all of our object variables are assigned here in a random manner.
                    <br><br>
                    Call Stack — this is where your function calls are stored.    
                     <br><br>
                     Event Queue — is a special queue, which keeps track of all the functions queues, which are needed to be pushed into the call stack. The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. The queue data structure is required to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.
